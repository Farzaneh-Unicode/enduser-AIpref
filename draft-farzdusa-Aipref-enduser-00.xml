   Standards can have a major impact on end users across technological,
   legal, ethical, and governance dimensions, largely centering around
   access to information, control over their digital contributions, and
   data privacy.  The purpose of this Internet Draft is to document the
   potential impact of signaling AI preferences on end users other than
   publishers, and to suggest some principles for the ai-pref working
   group to consider when assessing proposed vocabulary and definitions
   IETF wishes to standardize for signaling.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>
   As AI systems start becoming a primary way people access and interact
   with information online, mechanisms for signaling AI preferences risk
   shaping far more than technical coordination.  While the AI-Pref
   Working Group focuses on enabling content hosts to express their
   preferences, these signals operate at the protocol layer, where they
   can quietly restrict access, chill lawful uses, and unintentionally
   fragment the open web.  End users, understood broadly in RFC 8890 as
   the human beings whose activities Internet standards support, include
   not only publishers and AI developers but also researchers,
   educators, people with disabilities, small creators, and the global
   public.  Many of these communities rely on rights to access,
   transform, and analyze information that could be undermined if
   preference signaling is interpreted or implemented as a form of
   control.  This draft outlines the potential impact of AI signaling on
   end users and proposes principles to ensure that standardization
   preserves interoperability, openness, and user agency.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="sect-2" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Who are the end users?</name>
      <t>
   Mark Nottingham the author of The Internet is for the End Users,
   proposes a definition for end users in RFC 8890: "end users" means
   human users whose activities IETF standards support, sometimes
   indirectly….End users are not necessarily a homogenous group; they
   might have different views of how the Internet should work and might
   occupy several roles, such as a seller, buyer, publisher, reader,
   service provider, and consumer.  An end user might browse the Web,
   monitor remote equipment, play a game, videoconference with
   colleagues, send messages to friends, or perform an operation in a
   remote surgery theater.  They might be "at the keyboard" or
   represented by software indirectly (e.g., as a daemon)".</t>
      <t>
   This broad definition is especially useful to keep in mind as the
   outputs from the AI preferences working group are likely to have an
   impact on a broad range of end users.  The dominant voices in the AI-
   pref working group so far have been “publishers” and AI developers,
   each of which are a kind of end user.  Other end users’ rights,
   interests, and access have been discussed less frequently.  When
   rights and interests are discussed, in general the rights under
   consideration are those of Intellectual Property Rightsholders, while
   the discussions rarely mention other rightsholders, such as people
   with rights to access to knowledge and essential services, or
   interested parties.</t>
      <t>
   There is a need to ensure that property and economic interests are
   aligned with fundamental human rights, such as the right to freedom
   of opinion and expression under Article 19 of the Universal
   Declaration of Human Rights.  Intellectual-property and market-based
   mechanisms should function in a way that supports, rather than
   constrains, the free circulation of information and ideas.</t>
      <t>
   While AI Preference signaling mechanisms are intended to give content
   hosts (or site operators) a means to signal how content is used by AI
   systems, they can result in unintended consequences that
   disproportionately harm end users, including researchers, people with
   disabilities, and commercial and non-commercial actors, thereby
   undermining the open Internet.  Site operators may signal
   restrictions over content or uses that they do not have the legal
   right to control, such as text and data mining permitted under
   copyright exceptions, accessibility tools, public-domain materials,
   or facts and information not protected by intellectual property
   rights.  When interpreted strictly by AI systems, such signals can
   create a chilling effect: researchers, accessibility developers, and
   others may refrain from lawful uses simply because they believe the
   content is off-limits.  This misalignment between technical signals
   and actual rights risks fragmenting access to knowledge and
   undermining the open Internet.</t>

      <name>The IETF’s mandate and the Approach to Signaling AI Preferences</name>
      <t>
   The IETF was never intended to serve as a forum for protecting
   business models from technological innovation or enforcing copyright
   regimes.  Its purpose is to maintain and advance the interoperability
   of the Internet, to ensure that diverse systems, services, and users
   can communicate seamlessly across technical and institutional
   boundaries.  A shift away from this focus risks turning what should
   be a technical coordination effort into a venue for regulating reuse
   at the protocol layer, well before any legal reasoning or due-process
   safeguards can apply.  If the IETF shifts toward a regime that
   encourages blanket prohibitions on data processing, regardless of
   context, consequence, or user benefit, we risk hardcoding a “chilling
   effect” into the infrastructure of the web itself.  And unlike lawful
   reuses, which are typically adjudicated through downstream legal
   reasoning, signaling operates at the technical layer, where denial is
   fast, quiet, and hard to contest.</t>

      <name>The Right to Access Knowledge and Avoiding Internet Fragmentation</name>
      <t>
   A major concern for end users is the potential restriction of access
   to information and essential services due to overly restrictive
   content signaling instituted by hosting platforms, creators and
   publishers.</t>
      <section anchor="sect-4.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Access to Information</name>
        <t>
   People globally are increasingly accessing essential services and
   knowledge through the Internet.  AI-enabled applications could
   potentially simplify access to knowledge and essential services
   provided online, such as healthcare and other services.  However, if
   signaling AI preferences reinforced by regulatory reference become
   too restrictive, it can have a chilling effect and the fundamental
   right to access information and essential services could be harmed.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-4.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Intellectual Property Overreach and Rights Delay</name>
        <t>
   Theorists of the Access to Knowledge (A2K) movement contend that
   current levels of Intellectual Property (IP) protection may be
   unbalanced regarding the right to access.  They argue that material
   interests are not simply equivalent to current IP provisions, and
   that "rights delayed are rights denied".  (Lea Shaver The Right to
   Science and Culture, 2010 Wis. L.  Rev. 121 (2010).</t>

      <section anchor="sect-4.3" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Risk of Web Fragmentation</name>
        <t>
   There is a tension between giving site operators and declarants
   (those who declare their preferences about AI data usage) granular
   control over content and maintaining an open Internet.  Implementing
   very restrictive mechanisms risks "building fortress walls around content" and sacrificing the open web, potentially throttling the
   future of knowledge and access to essential services.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-4.4" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Impact on AI Tool Utility</name>
        <t>
   While large AI companies are the primary targets of restrictive
   preference signals, these controls can inadvertently restrict and
   harm end users who wish to use AI tools for common tasks like
   exploring content, summarizing, or translating documents or making
   services more accessible.  Setting a high bar for accessing and using
   information could negatively affect individual end users' ability to
   utilize these tools and overall experience when accessing the world
   wide web.  Ultimately, it is individual people who will pay the price
   for restricted access to AI tools, both financially and by IETF-
   endorsed limits on their ability to use AI to access the knowledge
   and information they seek.  Open source AI developers and others can
   also be disenfranchised if the preferences signals are not coherently
   implementable or if they have chilling effects.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-4.5" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Site operators don’t own everything on their website</name>
        <t>
   Any given web page has the technical capacity to contain content from
   a variety of different rightsholders.  A large platform can therefore
   contain content from millions, even billions, of different content
   creators.  Giving a website owner the ability to determine the AI
   preferences for potentially millions of different creators and their
   works risks centralizing a huge amount of control.</t>

    <section anchor="sect-5" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Impact on User Rights, Transformation, and Academic Research</name>
      <t>
   End users who are researchers are frequently hindered by licensing
   and contractual barriers, even when the underlying uses might be
   legally permissible under copyright law.</t>
      <section anchor="sect-5.1" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Robots Rights to Read</name>
        <t>
   Researchers and other end users face a tension when downloading and
   human (consumptive) reading is allowed, but machine (non-consumptive)
   reading is disallowed, leading to the slogan “let the robots read.”
   Robots are perhaps always the agents of human users and preventing
   them from reading could ultimately prevent the humans from access.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-5.2" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Use in the public interest</name>
        <t>
   The principle of allowing public interest uses of information has
   long supported knowledge production and freedom of expression.  These
   uses are without payment nor permission, rejecting the idea that
   access to information is "a privilege reserved for the well-behaved".
   In the AI-Pref discussions, many participants expressed a desire to
   differentiate between traditional search engine indexing—generally
   accepted as beneficial to the open web—and newer AI-enabled
   summarization or answer generation.  Some content providers signaled
   that they may be open to appearing in classic search results but not
   in AI-driven outputs that repackage or synthesize their material.
   However, this signaling raises a deeper structural issue: by opting
   out, publishers and intellectual property rights holders and hosts
   effectively shift the burden of determining whether a use is
   permitted to the recipient of the signal.  While this may not be a
   significant obstacle for well-resourced actors like major platforms,
   it imposes disproportionate risks on small operators, open-source AI
   developers, and actors from the global majority, those who often lack
   the legal infrastructure, funding, or access to navigate complex
   copyright frameworks.</t>

      <name>Shortcomings of Restricting RAG and Inference</name>
      <t>
   Restricting RAG and inference, uses that occur after the foundation

        <name>Collateral Damage to End Users and Beneficial Applications</name>

        <name>Risk to Automated Tools and Access to Knowledge (A2K)</name>
        <t>
   If restrictions on inference are applied too broadly, end users who
   wish to use AI tools for common tasks like discovering content,
   summarizing documents, or translation would be barred from doing so.
   This directly undermines the end user's right to access knowledge

      <section anchor="sect-6.3" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Discouraging Personal Use of Automation</name>
        <t>
   End users want to benefit from the efficiencies of automation, such
   as using bulk operations and automated search features, rather than
   having to rely solely on large, proprietary AI company tools.
   Placing the same restrictive bar on individual end users as on large
   AI developers for using information could negatively affect the
   ability of individuals to leverage these tools for personal or
   beneficial research purposes.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-6.4" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Accessibility Concerns</name>
        <t>
   Overly restrictive inference controls, such as a complete opt-out of
   “all data mining, automation and processing”, carry the risk of
   affecting uses like spam filtering, harmful language detection, and
   accessibility tools.  For instance, if a tool that describes a
   website to a visually impaired user relies on inference, a broad
   restriction could prevent that legitimate use.</t>

        <name>The Crawl Time vs. Inference</name>
        <t>
   Preference signals (like those in robots.txt or metadata) are
   available at crawl time, but they are often disassociated from the
   model when the content is actually used at inference time.  This
   could create mixed signals as to what the end user can do regarding
   the crawling vs inference and signaling about inference because of
   this time lag can create many problems for the end users, real time
   translation for example might not happen.</t>

        <name>Difficulty in Allowing Non-Commercial and Excluding Commercial Crawling</name>
        <t>
   For a general-purpose foundational model (LLM), it is technically
   difficult to distinguish between commercial and non-commercial uses
   at either crawl or inference time.  Because models cannot selectively
   isolate or invoke portions of their training data based on the
   eventual use context, a blanket “No AI” or similar restrictive signal
   tends to apply universally — even to lawful, commercial and non-
   commercial, or public-interest uses.  This leaves developers and
   researchers with “unappealing choices,” such as omitting the data
   entirely or creating separate models for every potential use
   category, both of which are impractical and risk excluding socially
   beneficial applications.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-7.3" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Uncertainty in Definition</name>
        <t>
   RAG is only one technique, and definitions of inference-time use are
   unstable.  The concept of "inference" is broad and covers a massive,
   conceptually fuzzy range of uses of material after training, making
   it difficult to develop a robust vocabulary term.  If standards focus
   too much on a specific technique like RAG, they risk becoming
   irrelevant as new techniques emerge.</t>

   Inference is becoming increasingly local (e.g., self-hosted models or
   on-device processing).  Asset-level control or signaling could
   intervene with an individual’s device, and there might be attempts to
   ensure a user cannot override a "no inference" flag for personal use
   (like translating a document), which is highly problematic.</t>

   A significant problem arising from this overreach is that creators

   Public websites, particularly those hosting user-generated content
   (UGC) like social media platforms, use broad Terms of Service (ToS)
   to assert extensive, contract-based control over content and data.
   If a site has content from many creators (e.g., social media
   platforms), the site administrator typically controls the location-
   based opt-out mechanisms (like robots.txt).  Consequently, the
   administrator "may not allow them [individual creators] to express their preferences fully, or at all".</t>

      <t>
   To the greatest extent possible, the goal should be to keep public
   information public and to keep the open web open.  Vocabulary
   standardized by IETF should not unduly restrict end user access to
   and ability to use public knowledge and information.  Definitions
   should be clear and narrowly tailored to be fit for purpose, rather
   than vague and broad.  End users should be able to understand the
   definitions without having technical or legal expertise.  End users
   should be able to use general purpose, commercially available tools
   to accomplish their own lawful activities, regardless of preferences
   to the contrary.</t>

      <name>Conclusion</name>
      <t>
   AI Preference signaling, while conceived as a mechanism for
   expressing control and transparency over the use of online content,
   risks evolving into an instrument that fragments the open Internet
   and uses of information.  The IETF’s role has never been to protect
   business models from innovation or to enforce intellectual property
   regimes.  Its role is to ensure interoperability and resilience
   across technical systems.  When preference signaling becomes a
   vehicle for implementing legal or economic restrictions at the
   protocol layer, it moves the IETF into a domain of governance that
   undermines its core mission and values.</t>
      <t>
   End users, whether researchers, accessibility developers, educators,
   or ordinary participants in the digital commons, stand to lose most
   from these shifts.  Overly restrictive signaling can chill legitimate
   research, disable accessibility tools, and entrench barriers to
   knowledge that the Internet was designed to dismantle.  By conflating
   technical coordination with policy enforcement, we risk replacing
   openness and innovation with exclusion and opacity.</t>
      <t>
   The AI-Pref Working Group should therefore focus on preserving
   interoperability and user agency, ensuring that standards remain
   technology-neutral, modular, and open to innovation.</t>

            <t>In many standards track documents several words are used to signify the requirements in the specification. These words are often capitalized. This document defines these words as they should be interpreted in IETF documents.
